Data Structures: The code utilizes an ArrayList<Integer> to hold the numbers. 

Algorithms: The input algorithm collects numbers from the user. The median calculation algorithm sorts the list and computes the median based on whether the count of numbers is even or odd. 

Time Complexity: The overall time complexity of the program is 𝑂 ( 𝑛 log ⁡ 𝑛 ) O(nlogn), primarily due to the sorting step.
