Handling Decimal Values for Miles: Changing int to double allows us to input decimal values like 20.5 for miles, avoiding the InputMismatchException.

Same Line Input: Using nextDouble() or next() in sequence allows us to handle multiple inputs on the same line, such as miles and gallons separated by a space.

Multiple Car Input: By modifying the program to accept two lines of input for different cars, miles, and gallons, we can compute and display the MPG for each car individually.


Data Structures: The code primarily uses primitive data types (double, String) and the Scanner class for input handling. 

Algorithms: The program implements input handling, calculations for MPG, and formatted output. 

Time Complexity: The overall time complexity of the program is ùëÇ ( 1 ) O(1), indicating that the execution time is constant and independent of input size.
