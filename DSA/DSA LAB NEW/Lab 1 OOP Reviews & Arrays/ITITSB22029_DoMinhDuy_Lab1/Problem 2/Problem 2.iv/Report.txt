Data Structures
Array:
The primary data structure used is a simple array of long values (long[] a).
An integer nElems keeps track of the number of elements currently in the array, ensuring the array can be treated as ordered.


Algorithms
Insertion:

The insert(long value) method finds the appropriate index for the new value using a linear search and then shifts larger elements up to make room for the new value.
Algorithm Type:
The initial search for the position is a linear search (O(n)).
The subsequent shifting of elements is also O(n) in the worst case.
Overall, the time complexity for insertion is O(n).
Searching:

The find(long searchKey) method uses binary search, which requires the array to be sorted.
It continually divides the search interval in half until the value is found or the interval is empty.
Algorithm Type: Binary search (O(log n)), which is efficient for sorted arrays.


Time Complexity
Insertion:
O(n) due to the linear search to find the position and the shifting of elements.
Searching (find):
O(log n) due to binary search, which is efficient for ordered data structures.
