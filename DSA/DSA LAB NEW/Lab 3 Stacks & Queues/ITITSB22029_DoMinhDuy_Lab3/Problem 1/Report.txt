Data Structure: Stack (LIFO)

Algorithms:
Decimal to Octal Conversion (based on repeated division by 8)
Stack Concatenation (using addAll())
Stack Comparison (using equals())

Time Complexity:
push(): O(1) for each element.
Decimal to Octal Conversion: O(log n), where n is the decimal number.
Stack Concatenation (addAll()): O(m), where m is the number of elements in stack2.
Stack Comparison (equals()): O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stacks being compared.
