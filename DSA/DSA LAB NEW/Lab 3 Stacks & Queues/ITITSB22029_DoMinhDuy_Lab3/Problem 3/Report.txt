Data Structures:
Array: Used to store 20 random integers.
Stack: Used for storing previous states of the array for undo/redo operations.

Algorithms:
Random Number Generation: Generates random values for the array.
Undo/Redo Operations: Implements undo and redo functionality by saving and restoring previous array states using two stacks.
Array Cloning: Copies the current state of the array to preserve history.

Time Complexity:
Array Access/Update: O(1) for updating or accessing a value at a specific index.
Array Cloning: O(n), where n = 20 (size of the array).
Stack Push/Pop: O(1) for pushing and popping from the undoStack and redoStack.
Display: O(n) to iterate through and print the entire array.
