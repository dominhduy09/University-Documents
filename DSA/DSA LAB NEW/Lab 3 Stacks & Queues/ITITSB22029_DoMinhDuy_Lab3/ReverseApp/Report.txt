1. Data Structure Used:
Stack: The primary data structure used in the code is a stack. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning that the last element pushed onto the stack will be the first element popped off.

Stack Operations:
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove an element from the top of the stack.
isEmpty: Check whether the stack is empty.
Array: The PersonStack internally uses an array (Person[] stackArray) to store Person objects. The array helps in efficiently managing the fixed number of Person objects within the stack.

List: The List<Person> is used to store the original and reversed list of Person objects in the main program. This list is created using the ArrayList class, which dynamically adjusts in size.

2. Algorithms:
Push to Stack Algorithm:

The algorithm iterates over the list of Person objects and pushes each person onto the stack.
The push operation appends a Person to the next available index in the stackArray.
Pop from Stack Algorithm:

The algorithm pops the Person objects from the stack in reverse order and adds them back to the reversedPersons list.
The pop operation retrieves the last inserted Person from the stack and decrements the top index.
Reversing Algorithm:

The process of reversing is achieved using the stack. By pushing all elements onto the stack and then popping them, we reverse the order of the elements. This is a classic use of the stack data structure to reverse a list.

3. Time Complexity:
Push Operation (Stack):

Each push operation is O(1) because adding an element to the stack (via the array) is a constant-time operation. The new Person object is added to the top of the stack and the top index is incremented.
Pop Operation (Stack):

Similarly, each pop operation is O(1) because removing an element from the top of the stack and decrementing the top index is done in constant time.
Reversing the List:

To reverse the list, the algorithm first iterates through all the elements in the list and pushes them onto the stack, which is O(n) where n is the number of Person objects.
Then, it iterates over the stack and pops each element to form the reversed list, which is also O(n).
